# Mini Project 1: BST - AVL, Heaps, and Applications of Priority Queues

This project involves implementing Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL tree data structures in C++, as well as solving engineering problems using priority queues. The project consists of three programs in C++ and a report explaining the strategy used to solve the problems in Part C. A demo and brief presentation about the solution approach will also be required for grading.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three parts:

1. BST-AVL API: Implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL tree data structure in C++ with self-balancing capabilities. Additional operations such as printing sum of nodes, finding the next element, printing elements between a range, and printing the height of the tree are also implemented.

2. Transforming an Array into a Heap: Implementing the heapify process to transform an array of integers into a min-heap, using a certain number of swaps.

3. Applications of Priority Queues: Designing algorithms for problem-solving using priority queues, and implementing the priority queue data structure in C++ using vectors.

## Features

- BST-AVL API with self-balancing capabilities
- Transforming an array into a min-heap
- Implementation of priority queue data structure using vectors
- Additional operations for BST, such as printing sum of nodes, finding next element, printing elements between a range, and printing height of the tree

## Learning Objectives

- Applying binary search trees and AVL trees to solve algorithmic problems
- Implementing heapify process to transform an array into a heap
- Designing algorithms for problem-solving using priority queues
- Understanding and implementing self-balancing mechanisms in BST
- Gaining proficiency in C++ programming

## Rubric for Evaluation

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Completion and correctness of implemented functions in all three parts
2. Proper implementation of self-balancing mechanism in BST and heapify process in Part 1 and Part 2
3. Design and efficiency of algorithms for problem-solving in Part 3
4. Code quality, including readability, organization, and documentation
5. Presentation and demo of the solution approach

## Project Deadline

The deadline for submission was March 15 at 11:59 pm. The presentation and demo of the solution approach are also required for grading, with the deadline on March 15 at class time.

## Conclusion

This project provides an opportunity to practice implementing various data structures and solving engineering problems using priority queues. It aims to develop proficiency in C++ programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving skills. Good luck!
